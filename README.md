# Memrise SRC Calculator
This is just a simple js script to run in node where you supply a number of Memrise cards to learn per day and how many days you intend to learn them, and it spits out a schedule so you can see how many cards you will have to review each day.

run with `npm start [batchSize] [days]`

The Memrise SRS algorithm was taken from their website message boards.

To see the output in a visual format (using React & Plotly), check out the [sample page](https://xferguson.github.io/memrise-src/)
